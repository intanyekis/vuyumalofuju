Five years ago, Emile Cilliers made headlines for his shocking attempt to end the life of his wife Victoria, which unfolded in a dark conspiracy involving tampering with her parachute.</p><p>During the trial, it came to light that he had plotted to collect her life insurance and use the money to start a new chapter with a lover. Despite tampering with her parachute before a skydiving incident in 2015, Victoria miraculously survived a 4,000ft fall. Cilliers’ sinister intentions were exposed in two trials, resulting in his conviction on two charges of attempted murder.</p><h2>Who Is Emile Cilliers?</h2><p><strong>Emile Cilliers</strong>, the man whose diabolical actions horrified the world as he attempted to end the life of his wife Victoria, gained notoriety for tampering with her parachute in a terrifying act of attempted murder. On a Sunday morning in 2015, Victoria, an experienced parachuting instructor, jumped from an aircraft at 4,000 feet, only for both her main and reserve parachutes to fail, leading to a near-fatal accident. Subsequent police investigations revealed that Cilliers had not only tampered with the parachute but had also attempted to murder her by damaging the gas valve at their Wiltshire house.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/newsnownigeria.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Emile-Cilliers-1.jpg alt="Emile Cilliers" width=400 height=400 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Victoria’s keen awareness saved her from the gas leak, which foreshadowed the parachute disaster. Interviews with key individuals, including police officials, shed light on Cilliers’ intentions and the events leading up to his arrest for attempted murder. The chilling details of his planned attempts on his wife’s life emerged, revealing a disturbing pattern of malice. Emile Cilliers faced justice in June 2018, receiving a life sentence for attempting to kill Victoria.

However, given Victoria’s current age of 47, it is estimated that Emile is in his early 50s or 60s. His arrest and subsequent conviction for attempted murder at Winchester Crown Court three years prior resulted in a minimum jail term of 18 years.</p><p>Victoria, a 47-year-old army physiotherapist, is grappling with the aftermath of the betrayal while raising their two children alone.
