He started to gain fame when his fanbase started publishing memes about him on TikTok. His YouTube account was first established on March 21, 2016, and his first video was published on December 21, 2017. On December 28, 2018, he did his first live broadcast about Fortnite; however, barely averaging with 2 people. He started uploading videos and livestreaming about the games NBA 2K and Fortnite Battle Royale in January 2020.</p><p>In June 2020, he was gradually increasing and had a following of around 10 people in his live streams each day. Weekly averages of 150 new subscribers and 350 viewers in his live streams appeared in the beginning of 2021, as he began to attract about 1k subscribers each week. He also has 4 million followers on his Instagram account, as of Nov 2022.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ishowspeed-net-worth></span>IShowSpeed Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>How much is the net worth of IShowSpeed?</strong> His monthly income is estimated to be $17.8K – $284.9K and yearly income is to be $213.7K – $3.4M, as of 2022.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ishowspeed-religion></span>IShowSpeed Religion<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>IShowSpeed belongs to Catholic religion. Interesting to note, he has a younger sister who sometimes enters his room during his livestreams to tell him “goodnight”.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ishowspeed-height-weight></span>IShowSpeed Height & Weight<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>How tall is IShowSpeed? </strong>He is 6’5″ tall and weighs around 71 Kg.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ishowspeed-girlfriend></span>IShowSpeed Girlfriend<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>IShowSpeed hasn’t been confirmed to date yet. He dated Ermony Renee. It’s uncertain if they’re still dating. It’s also feasible that he had a connection with Ava Barbie, a transsexual TikTok star and singer.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ishowspeed-personal-stats></span>IShowSpeed Personal Stats<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><figure class=wp-block-table><table class=has-fixed-layout><tbody><tr><td>Real Name</td><td>IShowSpeed</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>17 years old (As of 2022)</td></tr><tr><td>Birthdate</td><td>January 21, 2005</td></tr><tr><td>Ethnicity</td><td>Mixed</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6 feet 5 inches</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>71 Kg</td></tr><tr><td>Measurements</td><td>36-29-21 inches</td></tr><tr><td>Biceps Size</td><td>21 inches</td></tr><tr><td>Girlfriend</td><td>Single</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$213.7K – $3.4M</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-is-ishowspeed></span>How Old Is IShowSpeed?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Many of his supporters are divided on whether or not he is 17 (born in 2005) or 19 (born in 2003). Darren’s claim that he is 19 was most likely made to give him a better chance at Discord E-dating competitions, but otherwise he wouldn’t disclose his real age.</p><p>However, on a video he made on December 22, 2020 doing a Q&A, he said (at the time) he was 15, turning 16 “in a minute”, thus making this argument technically useless.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKGjnby4v8%2BenJ1lp564qnnBoqZmmZeaerOxy6KeoqeeYrWmtcahq2avlZ60qcCMpqarnV8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ruth-adekola.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ruth Adekola</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-waylon-kurts-transgender-gender-family-and-partner-revealed.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is Waylon Kurts Transgender?
