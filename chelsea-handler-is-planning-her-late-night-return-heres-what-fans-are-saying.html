Network. She hasn't done late night in the years since, however, upon returning to late night to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">guest-host Jimmy Kimmel Live! for a week</a>, the comedian decided now would be a good time to return. Handler was blessed with the opportunity to fill in for Kimmel during the time when women's rights were being stripped away by the government, which Handler obviously had a lot of opinions on that she gladly shared with the world.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Does Chelsea Handler's Boyfriend Jo Koy Do For A Living?</a></span>Handler announced on her Twitter shortly after her stint as guest-host that she is "ready" to return to late night.

They said that "we need a female host on a major network in late night," which a lot of fans seem to agree with.
