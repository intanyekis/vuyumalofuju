It took quite some time to find the right actress to bring the story to life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jon M.

While Ross's recent on-screen credits are just straight-up high school roles, he was still given a chance to audition for Nick's character, a history professor in the film. But he did not end up with the role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It ended up going to Henry Golding.

However, persistence is key, and Henry eventually took on Nick's part making this movie his very first acting credit.</p><p>And speaking of persistence, that's what got Constance Wu her part in the movie as the leading lady Rachel Chu. Well, perseverance and a little heartfelt email. In a Q&A with Channel 24, Constance revealed that she almost wasn't cast as Rachel after meeting with Jon and a producer of the film Nina Jacobson because of scheduling conflicts with her TV series Fresh Off the Boat.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then something clicked in her mind, and Constance was determined to try and make it work out because she wanted to be a part of Crazy Rich Asians so badly.
