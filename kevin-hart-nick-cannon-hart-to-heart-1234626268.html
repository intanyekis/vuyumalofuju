It’s like Spades, I got eight and a possible nine,” Canon responds when Hart asks how many children his Real Husbands Of Hollywood&nbsp;costar has. They both laugh and Cannon continues, “I like children, damn it!”</p><p>He added, “It gives me the ability to say, ‘Man I can affect so much,’ ” he tells Hart.</p><p>Cannon is the father of seven children total. His eldest children are 10-year-old fraternal twins, Moroccan and Monroe, with ex-wife Mariah Carey. The “Gigalo” rapper shares a four-year-old son Golden and a nine-month-old daughter Powerful Queen with Brittany Bell.

His youngest child, with Alyssa Scott, is baby Zen Scott Cannon born on June 23.</p><p>During a recent appearance on <a href=#>The Breakfast Club,</a>&nbsp;the&nbsp;Wild N Out&nbsp;creator explained his perspective on monogamy and marriage as “a Euro-centric concept.”</p><p>Beyond parenting, Hart and Cannon also discussed comedy from a professional standpoint, sharing how they viewed each other and their earned opportunities in Hollywood. The co-stars also chatted about Cannon landing the lead role in the 2002 film Drumline and opened up on&nbsp;how their relationship as peers and friends has evolved.</p><p>“There was a high amount of envy early on in our careers” revealed Hart. “I remember you were clicking so fast. You were putting the beats together so quick.”</p><p>The Ride Along star continued, “Every young black actor in Hollywood at the time, this was the role of a lifetime for so many. I remember when you got the part, there was no animosity. There was no ill-will, like, ‘Damn. I can’t believe I didn’t get it. Damn, it went to Nick Cannon.’ It was like ‘That’s a good dude. That’s a good dude. He deserved it. And you not only rocked that opportunity, but as others came…we developed a great energy and it’s always been that yin and yang.”</p><p>“It’s interesting too when you talk about that, clearly, I’m not a competitive person by any means, but I also understand what you’re talking about,” Cannon responded.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Hart To Heart</a>&nbsp;drops new episodes in batches on Thursdays on the streaming platform Peacock.
