During the chat, the rapper — and co-host of FOX SOUL’s live talk show The Mix, relaunching on Oct. 6 – reflected on how in April, fans went rabid over the idea of Romeo, 31, taking on Bow Wow (born <strong>Shad Moss</strong>, 33) in the head-to-head battle. Instead of reheating their decades-old beef, Romeo announced <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>in August</a> that he reached out to Bow Wow to do a documentary about their careers. “[Bow Wow and I] were literally the face of a generation. I know now a lot of people may try to downplay that, but what me and him did for the culture of hip hop, it will never be done again at that age, and I just want to give people their roses, you know?”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“People always put us against each other and me and him know it’s funny,” Romeo told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong>. “We used to have Valentine’s Day Parties together where the girls would be going crazy. They’d be like, ‘Rom and Bow Wow throwing a Valentine’s Day party together?’ It was crazy. We’ll be hoopin’ at UCLA together. We’d have workout nights when we were younger, so I just think the world wanna compare and make you compete, but the truth is, — they’ll be surprised if they knew the real story behind our story, and I think that’s how you inspire the world.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/romeo-miller-bow-wow-inspiration-ap-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>As for when fans can expect this Romeo/Bow Wow documentary, he tells <strong>HollywoodLife </strong>that he’s “still on it,” and things are in the works. “I’ve reached out [to Bow Wow]. He reached out to me one time. I haven’t heard back, but I think after everything slows down, we’ll get the ball rolling on that, so it’s to be continued right now.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Like <strong>Christina Aguilera </strong>and <strong>Britney Spears,</strong> or like the <strong>Backstreet Boys </strong>and <strong>NSYNC</strong>, Romeo (fka <strong>Lil Romeo</strong>) and Bow Wow (fka <strong>Lil’ Bow Wow</strong>) were seemingly pitted against each other because of their similarities. They were both teenage rappers who debuted in the early 2000s, and while it never got to the level of <strong>Tupac Shakur</strong>/<strong>The Notorious B.I.G.</strong>, there seemed to be some rivalry there. Romeo has since said that this beef was mostly fueled by the media.&nbsp;However, their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>more recent drama</a> – which has been captured on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Growing Up Hip Hop </a>– has been over a love triangle involving <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Angela Simmons</strong></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/romeo-miller-bow-wow-inspiration-ap-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Could these two keep their love and hip hop separate long enough for a friendly Verzuz battle? “You could wait and see!” he told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong>. “That’s the beauty of life! That’s why we live, right? You never know what’s to come tomorrow, but that’s just something where I want to make sure I’m giving the proper roses to those who inspired me. Bow was definitely an inspiration. I think it’s like with <strong>LeBron James</strong>. ‘Who’s better? <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Michael Jordan</strong></a> or<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> <strong>Kobe</strong> [<strong>Bryant</strong>]</a>? We’re all great in our own sense.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“It doesn’t always have to be a competition,” added Romeo. “I think this world we always want to knit pick and make everything a competition. It’s like, let’s celebrate the success that was made. Let’s celebrate these two young kids who made a difference. These two African American kids who actually chased their dreams and accomplished it at such a young age. Like I said, you never know. I’m one of those people who’s a go with the wind kind of guy.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Romeo can be seen on FOX SOUL’s The Mix.
