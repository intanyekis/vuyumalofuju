The stunning singer, 79, saw her career skyrocket as a vocalist with <strong>The Supremes</strong> before branching off into a solo career that has been nothing short of epic. Her first number one solo single, “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough” is an instantly recognizable classic, and she’s even co-hosted the Academy Awards! In 1974, she broke barriers by becoming the first African-American woman to co-host the ceremony, alongside <strong>John Huston</strong> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Burt Reynolds</strong></a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Offstage, the glamorous goddess had a fulfilling family life. She welcomed five children across two marriages (including daughter <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Tracee Ellis Ross</strong></a>), and is also a stepmother to three. In April of 2023, fellow Motown legend <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Smokey Robinson</a></strong> revealed an <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>alleged affair with Diana</a>, sparking renewed interest in her personal life.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Here’s what to know about Diana’s most important intimate relationships, including her two marriages.</p><h2>Robert Ellis Silberstein</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Diana-Ross-husband-ss-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Diana was two months pregnant with a child she conceived with Motown bigshot <strong>Berry Gordy</strong> when she decided to marry music exec <strong>Robert Ellis Silberstein</strong> in January of 1971. <strong>Rhonda Suzanne Silberstein&nbsp;</strong>was born the following August, and Robert raised her as his own. They subsequently welcomed two more daughters into their family, including <strong>Tracy Joy Silberstein</strong> (better known to Blackish fans <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>as actress Tracee Ellis Ross</a>) in 1972 and <strong>Chudney Lane Silberstein,&nbsp;</strong>born three years later in 1975.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>In a January 1976 issue of <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>, Bob opened up about how their relationship began. “No one introduced us,” he told the magazine, and Diana reportedly like to joke that she “picked him up.” Ultimately, she says she met him while shopping for a gift for Berry at a shop in Los Angeles. There, she spotted Bob and asked for his help selecting the present. She found him to be, she related, “a rare thing, a gentleman who is young, alive and very handsome—all the fantasy things you think of in a husband.”&nbsp;She also sweetly shared that she knew they were a couple when he bought her red PJs to match his.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>And their relationship, despite being in the same business, remained personal. “I would never manage Diane,” he said, referring to her as close friends did. He added, “she’s been in the business a lot longer than I have and I respect her advice.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>They divorced in 1977 and remain friendly to this day.</p><h2>Arne Næss Jr.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Diana-Ross-husband-ss-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>Diana next married Norwegian shipping magnate <strong>Arne Næss Jr </strong>in 1986. With her second marriage, she became a stepmother — Arne brought older children <strong>Katinka</strong>, <strong>Christoffer</strong>, and singer <strong>Leona Naess&nbsp;</strong>to the blended family. She also became a boy mom! The couple welcomed sons <strong>Ross Arne</strong> in 1987 and <strong>Evan Olav</strong> in 1988. But it wasn’t meant to be either, and they divorce in 2000 amid reports that Arne had fathered a child in Norway, per The Chicago Tribune&nbsp;in 2014.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Diana-Ross-husband-ss-embed-4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>In February of 2011, Diana told <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Oprah Winfrey</strong></a> during an appearance on her show that she considers Arne the love of her life.

But it was beautiful. She’s a beautiful lady, and I love her right till today,” he told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Guardian</a> in an interview. Smokey also revealed that <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>he was married</a> to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Claudette Rogers Robinson </strong></a>at the time, and claimed the affair lasted a year.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>“She’s one of my closest people,” the 83 year old Motown singer said. “She was young and trying to get her career together. I was trying to help her. I brought her to Motown, in fact. I wasn’t going after her and she wasn’t going after me. It just happened.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Smokey also shared that it was Diana who nixed the year long relationship. “After we’d been seeing each other for a while, Diana said to me she couldn’t do that because she knew Claudette, and she knew I still loved my wife,” he explained. “And I did. I loved my wife very much.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8OimKeZXae8tL%2BMoaysmpGjsW6Bj3Fua3BmZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./paul-hunt.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Paul Hunt</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./graham-gano.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Graham Gano</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-leroux-car-accident-update-death-and-cause-news-gone-viral.html>Ava Leroux Car Accident Update: Death And Cause News Gone Viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./baby-smoove-net-worth.html>Baby Smoove Net Worth How Much is Baby Smoove Worth?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./james-remar.html>James Remar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenyon-martin-basketballplayer-htm.html>Kenyon Martin Jr - Biography, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-durant-wiki-height-weight-age-girlfriend-family-biography-more.html>Kevin Durant Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ.
