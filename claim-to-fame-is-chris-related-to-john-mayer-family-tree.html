Early on, he makes it clear that his cousin, whom he believes is his uncle, and he both have musical talent.</span></p><p><span>However, the two truths and a lie game raise the possibility that his claim of having a renowned uncle is untrue, prompting several cast members to speculate that he might be related to John Mayer.</span></p><p><span>Hey, he does have eyes like the musician and a singing voice like him. However, who exactly is Chris from Fame to Claim?</span></p><p><span>We did some research after seeing the Season 2 opener to determine who Chris is related to, and no, he doesn’t have the well-known uncle he claims to have in the reality competition series.</span></p><p><span>Chris Osmond spoke about having a famous father during an interview with the “</span><span>Lemonade Stand Stories Podcast</span><span>,” but it turned out that Chris Osmond is Donny Osmond’s son.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=claim-to-fame-chris-family-tree></span><span>Claim To Fame: Chris Family Tree</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Chris’ parents are Donald Clark Osmond and Debra.

The dynamic combo was successful musically, achieving numerous top-ten hits, winning gold records, and entertaining authorities on television.</span></p><p><span>Chris Osmond has four brothers: Don, Jeremy, Brandon, and Joshua Osmond, to name a few.</span></p><p><span>The first of Christopher’s three older brothers is Donald Clerk Osmond Jr., born on July 31, 1979.</span></p><p><span>Similarly, Donny Osmond’s second child, Jeremy James Osmond, was born on June 8, 1981. He performs physical therapy work.</span></p><p><span>The third kid of Donny Osmond was born on January 29, 1985. His name is Brandon Michael Osmond.

On Instagram, Donny gushed next to a picture of the bride and groom.</span></p><p><span>“It was indeed the ideal wedding, held in the ideal location. We are happy for you, including your mother. We are so proud to call you our daughter, Alta.</span></p><p><span>Aussie Rae Osmond, the singer’s daughter with Alta, was born on November 26, 2020, as he and Alta shared on Facebook.</span></p><p><span>“Words cannot express the love we feel for this little one,” the adoring father gushed in his caption. “She has given Al and me a whole new perspective on life just in the last two days,” Al said.</span></p><p><span>Precisely this is what’s important here! We can’t wait to bring her home today. There isn’t a finer way to celebrate Thanksgiving, in my opinion.</span></p><p><span>For Chris, becoming a father was a wonderful dream come true.
