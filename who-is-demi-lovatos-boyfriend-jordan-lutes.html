She was cast by Disney for their television film series Camp Rock and in their show Sonny With A Chance. Over the years, Demi has been very public about her struggles with substance abuse. The singer released HOLY FVCK in August 2022 – and Demi wasn't limited to "recording an album" at the time.</p><p><strong>Updated, September 2023:</strong> Demi Lovato was in the news for a few reasons in September, one of which was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her surprise appearance on The Masked Singer</a>. After Demi was unmasked, told host <a href=#>Nick Cannon</a> why she wanted to work on the show:</p><p>"I wanted to do your show because it seemed so fun ... And I get to sing, so it's the best of both worlds." Earlier in the episode – before Demi was unmasked – she provided hints about her identity. Demi said her "big break came when [she] was able to showcase [her] voice."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jordan Lutes collaborated with Demi Lovato <a href=#>on the album </a><a href=#>HOLY FVCK</a>. He is a musician, specifically in the indie punk rock genre— one Demi enjoys dabbling in—and he uses the penname Jutes. Lutes has also struggled with substance abuse, and shared the news he was 100 days sober on Instagram.</p><p>The couple have so much in common, fans are shocked they have not been dating for longer!

They dated for 6 years, and even after their break-up Valderrama was there for Lovato during her hospitalization due to an overdose.</p><p>When Demi and Wilmer were a couple, their fans thought they were perfect for each other – but Demi's song ‘29’ from her album HOLY FVCK tells a different story. Wilmer was 29 when they met and began dating, while Demi was only 17. The song suggests Wilmer may have taken advantage of Demi.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Demi Lovato Reveals Dating A Man 13-Years Older Than Her Made Her Feel 'Gross'</a></span></p><h2 id=then-demi-was-rumored-to-be-dating-a-musician-again><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Then Demi Was Rumored To Be Dating A Musician (Again)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar51787666.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before Demi was publicly linked with Jordan Lutes, circulating social media rumors suggested that the singer was dating a fellow musician. Demi had not publicly dated a singer since a brief fling with Joe Jonas in 2010. Instead, Demi has stuck to actors and UFC fighters—and even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one contestant from </a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Bachelorette</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Joe Jonas' Bizarre Addiction Rumor Caused The Musician To Clarify His Mysterious Personal Life</a></span></p><p>Fans of Demi were eager to determine who the mystery musician might be.

He was initially signed with Capital Records, but eventually chose to leave the label.

His song ‘Hollywood Hillbilly’ was released in August 2022.</p><h2 id=how-demi-lovato-met-jordan-lutes><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>How Demi Lovato Met Jordan Lutes</span></h2><p>Just as actors often meet their significant others on set, musicians are known to meet new love interests while making music. This was the case for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Demi Lovato and Jordan Lutes</a>. “They bonded over music,” a source revealed to E! News about the new couple. “Things are going really well and they have a lot in common.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While fans do not yet know exactly when they met, it was clear they kept their new romance under wraps for months. They remained quiet about their relationship as they got to know one another, before sharing adorable photos of each other on social media and being spotted out and about on dates. “She’s definitely smitten.”</p><h2 id=jordan-collaborated-on-demi-rsquo-s-holy-fvck><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Jordan Collaborated On Demi’s HOLY FVCK</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar52871773.jpg><p>Demi and Jordan's shared efforts can be heard on Demi's album HOLY FVCK. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lutes is credited for co-writing three songs on the album</a>, most notably Lovato’s single ‘Substance' – which she performed on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. Lutes has said ‘Substance’ is one of his favorites from a production standpoint.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lutes is also credited with co-writing ‘Happy Ending’ and ‘City of Angels’ on Demi's album.</p><h2 id=jordan-wants-to-act><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Jordan Wants To Act</span></h2><p>While Jordan's career has been solely music based so far, he set his sights on other aspects of the entertainment industry. The musician is extremely talented – and he attended film school. Jordan hopes to use all aspects of his character to make art, and he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spoke to The Nuance Magazine about wanting to draw and act</a>:</p><p>“I draw as well and want to make my own animated show with my homie from Toronto who I met in film school ... Would love to act eventually as well.”</p><p>Fans are hoping Lutes will get the chance to share the rest of his talents with the world.</p><h2 id=jordan-is-sober><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Jordan Is Sober</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couple have something else in common: sobriety. Demi has been very public about her fight with addiction. She has spoken about the pitfalls and relapses she has experienced in documentaries, as well as writing about addiction in songs such as ‘Dancing With The Devil’ and ‘Sober.’ <a href=#>HOLY FVCK is the first album she has recorded completely sober</a>.</p><p>Jordan Lutes is on a sobriety journey as well. He took to Instagram in 2022 to share an update on his sobriety. “Today marks 100 days sober,” Lutes said in the post. “I’ve never felt better mentally and emotionally.”</p><h2 id=demi-and-jordan-are-perfect-together><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Demi And Jordan Are Perfect Together</span></h2><p>Demi has had an ongoing fight with addiction. She has relapsed in the past, one instance causing her to be hospitalized and putting her life at risk. Fans are so happy to see Demi in a happy and healthy relationship, specifically for her ongoing sobriety. Being around a fellow sober person can really help with the fight against addiction, and it seems Demi has found her person.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Demi and Jordan seem to be able to lean on each other when needed, while also still being strong independently with their sobriety.
