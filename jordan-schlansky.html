The eight episodes of Conan O’Brien’s Late Night, which were broadcast from 1998 to 2000, were a big success.</p><p>He acquired a lot of fan following and outstanding show results during this period. For the 2003 Late Night with Conan O’Brien: 10th Anniversary special, Schlansky was then also named as the associate producer.</p><p>Schlansky revealed the name of Emma as his fiancée and told her that he had met her in a shop.
