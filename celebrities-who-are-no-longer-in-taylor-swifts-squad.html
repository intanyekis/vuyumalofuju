The singer first came to prominence back in the world of country music, however, Swift quickly claimed her crown as one of the leading queens in pop!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With one successful album after the next, Taylor has found herself at the top of the leaderboard with a friend group to die for! Swift has culminated quite the group of gal pals over the course of her career, who has come to be known as the Swift Squad.</p><p>Many might have&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">forgotten a few celebs in Taylor's squad</a>,&nbsp;it appears as if that won't be necessary considering a few have found themselves on the outs.&nbsp;Luckily for Taylor, she's found a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">new friend in Olivia Rodrigo,</a> however, not everyone is so lucky!</p><p><strong>Updated on July 13th, 2021 by Michael Chaar:</strong>&nbsp;Taylor Swift's very exclusive squad has been a hot topic since forever! While the 'Bad Blood' singer is still close with a few of her girlfriends, including Selena Gomez and Camilla Cabello, many of her friendships have dwindled over time. &nbsp;Luckily for Swift, her friendship turn rivalry with Katy Perry came to an end following <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their truce back in 2019.</a> While Taylor's friendly days with Emma Stone are over, that didn't stop Emma from gushing about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her fav tracks off of Folklore</a>, proving that there is definitely still love between the two. While Emma and Taylor seem fine, the same can't be said for Lorde, Ellie Goulding, and Karlie Kloss, all of whom have ties to Scooter Braun and a few of Taylor's exes. Oops!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=katy-perry><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Katy Perry</span></h2><p>Believe it or not, Taylor Swift&nbsp;and Katy Perry&nbsp;used to be pretty close friends. They hung out together, performed together, and even went to each other’s birthday parties. The drama started thanks to some backup dancers who were working with Katy on her tour, and then switched to Taylor’s, before going back to Katy’s. This caused a<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> feud between the two</a> that got worse when Katy started dating John Mayer, an ex of Taylor’s.</p><p>Related: <a href=#>Taylor Swift's BFF Squad Members Ranked By Instagram Followers</a></p><p>Things got heated as they both released diss tracks about one another — 'Bad Blood' for Taylor and 'Swish Swish' as Katy’s response. Thankfully, after a lot of jabs back and forth, Katy extended an olive branch (literally) and the two put their differences behind them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We're not sure how they stand, though, as Katy was seen at a fundraiser hosted by Scooter Braun, who is not on Taylor's good side right now. Luckily for Perry, that's all behind her as she embarks on her newest journey as a mother, alongside her hubby, Orlando Bloom.</p><h2 id=lorde><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Lorde</span></h2><p>At one point, Taylor Swift&nbsp;and Lorde were very close friends, and Lorde&nbsp;was a very active member of Taylor's squad. The two often hung out together, and Lorde even joined Taylor on stage during her concert tour a few times. Things went downhill for the two when Lorde started to get cozy with music producer, Jack Antonoff.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jack and Taylor have worked together to write and produce songs together on many occasions, and at one point <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he was working with Lorde</a>. Jack was also dating another squad member, Lena Dunham, to make things worse.</p><p>Jack and Lorde were getting very close, and Taylor didn't like it, which was why she decided to distance herself from Lorde. Lorde is now set to release her upcoming album, Solar Power, which will be released this August!</p><h2 id=lena-dunham><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Lena Dunham</span></h2><p>Speaking of Lena Dunham, she was also very close with Taylor Swift, and highly involved with the squad. These days, Lena has admitted that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she prefers to not be involved</a> with the squad, and she'd rather have one-on-one time with her friends instead of hanging out in a big group.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor also still works rather closely with her ex, Jack Antonoff, as the two are constantly writing songs together, and coming up with ideas for Taylor's new music. We imagine that the fact that Taylor works so closely with Lena's ex can be a tad awkward, and we don't blame Lena for putting some distance between them.</p><h2 id=emma-stone><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Emma Stone</span></h2><p>There was once a time in which Taylor Swift and Emma Stone were really close friends. They were constantly hanging out as Emma was a dedicated member of Taylor's squad. Over the years it seemed like the two drifted apart as they were seen together less and less, especially considering Emma's dislike for living life so publicly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>What Taylor Swift's Girl Squad Members Are Doing Now</a></span></p><p>She was not a part of Taylor's 'Bad Blood' music video, which included most of her squad members, so it seemed as if the two had simply grown apart.</p><p>Unfortunately, that happens with many friendships, so it's probably safe to say that Emma is no longer in the squad. Although they aren't as close as they once were, that didn't stop Emma Stone from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sharing the love</a> when it came to Taylor's Folklore release.</p><h2 id=kendall-jenner><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Kendall Jenner</span></h2><p>Despite everything that happened with Kanye West, Kendall Jenner and Taylor Swift were rather close! We all remember when Kanye West interrupted Taylor's speech at the MTV Video Music Awards, and since then, Kanye and Taylor have been back and forth with the jabs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In support of her then-husband years later, Kim Kardashian decided to share "receipts" with the world proving that Taylor's continued beef with Kanye was all for publicity. Of course, Hollywood was then divided into Team Kim and Team Taylor, and Kendall had taken the side of her sister and her brother-in-law, putting her family first.</p><p>Kendall is now a trendsetter in the spirits industry, having released her very own tequila line, called 818, which <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sparked a lot of controversy</a> at the start of its campaign.</p><h2 id=dianna-agron><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Dianna Agron</span></h2><p>Back in the day, actress Dianna Agron was once a part of Taylor Swift's squad and was friendly with the '22' singer. The two were often seen hanging out together, but over the years, they started to grow apart.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back in 2016 Dianna and Winston Marshall of the band Mumford & Sons&nbsp;tied the knot in 2016, bud sadly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">separated in 2020</a>. She's been busy with her own personal life, so we haven't seen her hanging out with Taylor in years, nor have they acknowledged one another on social media at all, making it clear that their days as friends are long gone!</p><h2 id=ellie-goulding><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Ellie Goulding</span></h2><p>Singer Ellie Goulding is yet another star who was once a part of Taylor Swift's squad, but these days, might not be in it any longer. Back before Taylor dated Calvin Harris, he dated Ellie. After he and Ellie broke up, the two were on good terms, so she introduced him to Taylor and they hit it off immediately.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Things We Just Learned About Taylor Swift’s Girl Squad</a></span></p><p>Unfortunately, Taylor and Calvin had a very nasty breakup, and they even shaded one another on social media. After the big blowout between Taylor and Calvin, Ellie was seen hanging out with Calvin, which might've sparked a fallout between Taylor and Ellie, as the two drifted apart.</p><p>While their peace may have been disrupted, that doesn't seem to be the case with Ellie anymore! The singer recently revealed that<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> she wrote a book</a> centered around remaining optimistic and calm!</p><h2 id=zendaya><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Zendaya</span></h2><p>Zendaya is another celebrity who was once a part of Taylor Swift's squad. Back during the Team Kim and Team Taylor feud,&nbsp;Zendaya took a stance on the matter which might've cost her a spot in the squad.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On Twitter, Zendaya favorited a few tweets that suggested that<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> she was on Kim's side of the feud</a> and that she's not involved with Taylor at all. Those tweets might've sealed the deal as the two haven't been together since. With all that being long gone for Zendaya, the actress is now busy collecting Emmy's and allegedly heating things up with Spider-Man co-star, Tom Holland.</p><h2 id=ruby-rose><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Ruby Rose</span></h2><p>Taylor Swift's squad is made up of so many different celebrities, some that make complete sense while others you wouldn't think would be a part of Taylor's friendship group. As for Ruby Rose, she's definitely one of those stars that you wouldn't think would fall in the squad category, but she definitely was at one point.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the years, the two have hung out quite a lot, and Ruby even voiced her support for Taylor during the Katy Perry feud. However, in the music video for Taylor's song, 'Look What You Made Me Do,' Taylor sports a t-shirt with all of her squad member's names on it, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ruby's name is noticeably absent</a>. Yikes!</p><h2 id=karlie-kloss><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Karlie Kloss</span></h2><p>For the longest time, Taylor Swift and Karlie Kloss were inseparable. The two were best friends and the closest out of everyone in Taylor's squad. Around 2016, people started to take notice that the two were hanging out less and less.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans had determined that there was some sort of fallout between the two as they had gone from constantly being together, to barely acknowledging each other. We're unsure what happened between them, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor didn't attend Karlie's wedding</a>. Karlie is also managed by Scooter Braun who Taylor publically fought over her music masters.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>What We Recently Learned About Taylor Swift And Selena Gomez's Friendship</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwMieqmavmKR6or7EZqWoZZyku6ix0Wagp2Wklsatu9FmqrChlqnAbr%2FQrpidZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./betsey-johnson-x-urban-outfitters-1997-dress-collection-details.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Betsey Johnson x Urban Outfitters 1997 Dress Collection: Details</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./reese-witherspoon-almost-ruined-her-image-by-dating-her-ex-husbands-friend-jake-gyllenhaal.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Reese Witherspoon's Rebound After Her Divorce Almost Ruined Her Hollywood Image</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-leroux-car-accident-update-death-and-cause-news-gone-viral.html>Ava Leroux Car Accident Update: Death And Cause News Gone Viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./baby-smoove-net-worth.html>Baby Smoove Net Worth How Much is Baby Smoove Worth?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./james-remar.html>James Remar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenyon-martin-basketballplayer-htm.html>Kenyon Martin Jr - Biography, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-durant-wiki-height-weight-age-girlfriend-family-biography-more.html>Kevin Durant Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ.
