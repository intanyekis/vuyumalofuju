He was active in politics, received a Grammy Award alongside CSN, appeared as an actor on various TV shows, and famously struggled with addiction. But behind the scenes, he was also a father, welcoming no fewer than six children across several relationships during his 81 years of life.&nbsp;“A lot of people don’t have a really good, strong reason that they believe in for their life to go forward,” he once said, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Fox News</a>. “Me, I do.

They decided to place him for adoption, though James and his biological father were later reunited. In fact, James is a musician as well — they performed together as the band <strong>CPR</strong> (Crosby, Pevar, & Raymond). According to David’s Wikipedia page, James also performed with the touring bands for Crosby & Nash and Crosby, Stills, & Nash.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Just two days ago on January 17, 2023, Crosby’s eldest child took to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> to announce an <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>upcoming appearance</a> at the Lobero Theater in California to celebrate the venue’s 150th anniversary. David was set to appear with his son at the Santa Barbara theater on February 22nd in “David Crosby and Friends.”</p><h2>Erika Keller Crosby</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>Erika Crosby</strong> was born to David and<strong> Jackie Guthrie,&nbsp;</strong>though her age and date of birth are unknown, as she has lived a private life out of the spotlight. However, it is known that she has four siblings on her mother’s side —&nbsp;<strong>Sarah Lee</strong>, <strong>Annie,</strong> <strong>Abe,</strong> and <strong>Cathy Guthrie,&nbsp;</strong>all of whom call folk singer <strong>Arlo Guthrie</strong> their dad. Jackie was ultimately married to Arlo for 43 years, dying of cancer in 2012, per<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> CBS News</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Erika is also apparently responsible for three of David’s grandchildren. “Erika has three kids, lives in Florida and is an incredibly smart, wonderful woman who I visit regularly because I love her dearly,” he said, according to a 2019 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Fox News</a> article.</p><h2>Donovan Crosby</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>David next welcomed daughter <strong>Donovan Crosby</strong> with <strong>Debbie Donovan.&nbsp;</strong>Very little is known about Donovan, though the rock legend did briefly address her as well, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Fox News</a>. “Donovan doesn’t really talk to me,” he reportedly said.</p><h2>Django Crosby</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/David-Crosbys-Kids-shutter-embed-4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>The musician and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jan Dance</strong></a>, who would later become his wife in 1987, welcomed son <strong>Django Crosby&nbsp;</strong>sometime in the mid 1980s. “Django lives with me and is an absolute joy,” David said of his son, who was by his side when he died. It was Django’s mother who announced the rock star’s death in a statement given to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>. &nbsp;“It is with great sadness after a long illness, that our beloved David (Croz) Crosby has passed away,” she wrote. “He was lovingly surrounded by his wife and soulmate Jan and son Django. Although he is no longer here with us, his humanity and kind soul will continue to guide and inspire us. His legacy will continue to live on through his legendary music. Peace, love, and harmony to all who knew David and those he touched. We will miss him dearly. At this time, we respectfully and kindly ask for privacy as we grieve and try to deal with our profound loss. Thank you for the love and prayers.”</p><h2>Bailey Jean Cypher</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/David-Crosbys-Kids-shutter-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>David’s youngest two children were sired by him, though he didn’t raise them. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Melissa Etheridge</strong></a> and her former partner <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Julie Cypher</strong></a> first admitted to David being the sperm donor for their two children in a January 10, 2000, story in Rolling Stone. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Bailey Jean Cypher</strong></a> was the first of those two children, born in 1997, and is now about 25 years old. She’s also a graduate of NYU.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>“I didn’t parent Bailey and Beckett, the two with Melissa [Etheridge and her ex-partner Julie Cypher], but I do love them,” David reportedly said in 2019, per Fox News.&nbsp; “Beckett’s somewhere in Colorado and Bailey just graduated from NYU today. They all apparently learned from my mistakes, because none of them are interested in hard drugs. I think they saw what happened and have avoided it, which certainly is a wonderful thing.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>On January 19, Bailey took to Instagram to pay tribute to her biological dad. “Rest easy Croz,” she <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>captioned a pic</a> of him playing the guitar. “Thank you for the tunes, the dimples, and the love.”</p><h2>Beckett Cypher</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/David-Crosbys-Kids-shutter-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-13>Like Bailey, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Beckett Cypher</strong></a> was born to Julie Cypher and Melissa Etheridge in 1998, with David Crosby as the sperm donor. And according to the 2000 Rolling Stone piece, Melissa once said “Beckett looks just like David, doesn’t he?” <span>However, Beckett’s life ended tragically when he died of causes <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>related to opioid addiction</a> in May of 2020 at the age of just 21.</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-14>“My son Beckett, who was just 21, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>struggled to overcome</a> his addiction and finally succumbed to it today,” Melissa wrote in part in <a class=multivariate href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a statement on Twitter</a>. “He will be missed by those who loved him, his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>family and friends</a>.
