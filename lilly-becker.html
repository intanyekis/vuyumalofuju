Besides that, she is also the representative of the handbag brands,&nbsp;<i>LeSportsac</i>.</p><p>Born on June 25, 1976, Lilly spent her childhood in Rotterdam, Netherlands. The Dutch national belongs to a mixed ethnic background. She was born under the birth sign of Cancer and is a devoted Christian. Her single life after divorce with Boris is going very well and if you want to know more about it, then read along.</p><h2>Current Relationship Status</h2><p>The gorgeous model and TV personality, Lilly is currently living a single life. She is also not spotted with any guy in public places at the moment. Perhaps, she is busy making her career, so she is not dating and romance with anyone.</p><p>She split from her husband Boris in May of 2018. In a recent report by the <i>Daily Mail</i>, Becker is enjoying her single life and is getting inspired by other divorcees. Lilly is taking this new single-mum status as a challenge and she is furthermore, part of the 'Drive for Change' program.&nbsp;</p><p>She joined other single mums in the program and drove between London, Paris, Geneva, and Monte Carlo. The program raised a whopping amount of <strong>$4.5 million</strong> for women empowerment projects. &nbsp;</p><h2>First Marriage with the Lawyer</h2><p>The 43-years-old model was married to&nbsp;<strong>Michael R. Bermann&nbsp;</strong>in&nbsp;<i>2003</i><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>Lilly's husband, Michael, is a lawyer as well as an entrepreneur. As per the sources, the duo first met at Miami beach.</p><p>Though they were a perfect match and walk down the aisle together, the exact wedding date and place are still unknown. The lovebirds might have dated each other before exchanging their wedding rings.</p><p>However, their relationship did not last long, and they finally filed for divorce in 2008.&nbsp;</p><h2>Second Spouse: Boris Becker&nbsp;</h2><p>After a year of judicial separation with Bermann, Lilly tied the knot for the second time with Boris Becker. Lily's second spouse, Boris, is a former professional Tennis player and an Olympic Gold Medalist. The duo dated for five years before walking down the aisle with each other.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/9/12/B+L-1568283060178.jpg><p>Lilly and Boris' bridal ceremony was held on<i>&nbsp;June 12, 2009,</i>&nbsp;in St.Moritz. However, the duo is not together as of 2019. They separated in&nbsp;<i>May 2018,&nbsp;</i>but the exact reason of their disunion is yet a mystery to their fans.&nbsp;</p><h2>Blessed with a Son</h2><p>Lilly has one son from her marital relationship with Boris Becker. She&nbsp;is raising her son <strong>Amadeus Benedict Edley Luis Becker </strong>as a single mother as of now. He was born on&nbsp;<i>February 9, 2010.</i></p><p>The former couple is now probably sharing the custody of their son, but it is not confirmed in the reports. Boris went <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>bankrupt</strong></a> after owning <strong>$4.36 million</strong> to private banks.</p><h2>Prosperous Manner of Living with Enormous Net Worth</h2><p>Lilly has earned a really good amount of wealth from her career as a model and TV personality. Her net worth is around&nbsp;<strong>$1 million</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/9/12/Cover-model-1568286113765.jpg><p>But her ex-husband, Boris Becker has an estimated net worth of around&nbsp;<strong>$10 million</strong>, which is quite less than that of another American tennis player&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Serena Williams</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>How much does she earn from the entertainment industry?</h2><p>According to <i>Glassdoor</i>, the average wage of a model ranges from&nbsp;<strong>$41,300 </strong>to<strong>&nbsp;$58,000&nbsp;</strong>per year. Hence we can easily assume the wage of Lilly Becker. Becker also summons a substantial wealth as a TV personality.&nbsp;</p><p>As a TV personality, Lilly earns an average remuneration of&nbsp;<strong>$74,100&nbsp;</strong>per year, which is the same as that of a TV personality&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Arissa Lebrock</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Next to Modeling, her non-primary source of income is from her endorsement deals with many fashion brands. Recently, she is the brand ambassador of the handbag brands,&nbsp;<i>LeSportsac</i>.</p><h2>Childhood & Parents</h2><p>Her father was&nbsp;<i>Swiss</i>, and mother was from&nbsp;<i>Suriname</i>. But their name is yet not disclosed. However, in&nbsp;<i>1979</i>, her parents died in a car accident when Lily was just three years old.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/9/12/Lilly-Beckenger-1568279361719.jpg><p>So, Lilly was raised by her uncle and aunt along with her sister,&nbsp;<strong>Melissa Kerssenberg,&nbsp;</strong>in Amsterdam. Furthermore, Lilly attended secondary school in Amsterdam.&nbsp;</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><p><i><strong>For more updates on Celebrity Divorce, we recommend visiting&nbsp;</strong></i><a href=#><i><strong>Married Celeb</strong></i></a><i><strong>!!!</strong></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqWgpaSpYq%2Bmr8qeqQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./boog-powell.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Boog Powell</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./scott-mitchells-net-worth-biography-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Scott Mitchells net worth, biography, fact, career, awards and life story</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-leroux-car-accident-update-death-and-cause-news-gone-viral.html>Ava Leroux Car Accident Update: Death And Cause News Gone Viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./baby-smoove-net-worth.html>Baby Smoove Net Worth How Much is Baby Smoove Worth?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./james-remar.html>James Remar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenyon-martin-basketballplayer-htm.html>Kenyon Martin Jr - Biography, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-durant-wiki-height-weight-age-girlfriend-family-biography-more.html>Kevin Durant Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ.
