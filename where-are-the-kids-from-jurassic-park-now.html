For one, it involved some elementary CGI and robotic dinos (hey, it was 1993) that were almost laughable in many scenes. But it&nbsp;also featured some scary moments that seemed super-real.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It might be a cringe-fest these days, to some extent, but there are also so many cool things that came from 'Jurassic Park.' And <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fans are still learning new things</a> about the set, the cast, and the franchise to this day.</p><p>Of course, one point of interest is what happened to the film's youngest stars, Joseph Mazzello (Tim) and Ariana Richards (Lex).</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Close Was Sandra Bullock To Starring In 'Jurassic Park'?</a></span></p><p>Working on 'Jurassic Park' may have launched the young stars' careers, but it wasn't exactly a cakewalk. In fact, at one point, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the cast was even trapped on the island</a> where they were filming.</p><p>But interestingly enough, those childhood roles weren't enough to discourage either Joseph or Ariana from pursuing careers in entertainment.</p><p>Ariana, the older of the two child actors, also appeared in the second iteration of 'Jurassic Park,' in a less significant role. But <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she also went on to pursue more diverse paths</a> in&nbsp;the creative realm. For one thing, she wound up recording a music album.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But both Richards and Mazzello wound up working in entertainment in some capacity.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> recapped Richards' career, explaining that while she wouldn't say no to some acting gigs (and in fact, the 41-year-old did appear in the 2013 film 'Battledogs,' her most recent role), she was also busy promoting her artwork around the globe.</p><p>Joseph Mazzello, on the other hand, used his Hollywood connections to pursue his dream career.&nbsp;People quoted him as saying that Steven Spielberg actually penned a letter of recommendation for the young star to submit to the University of Southern California. Mazzello got in, and also explained, that Steven has "been there" for him throughout his life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mazzello, now in his 30s, went on to act&nbsp;and direct, with his most recent role being that of John Deacon alongside Rami Malek in 'Bohemian Rhapsody.' His recent directorial project? 'Undrafted' in 2016.</p><p>But fans may also remember Joseph from his role as Dustin Moskovitz in 'The Social Network.' Clearly, both the child stars have grown plenty since their time on 'Jurassic Park.'</p><p>The thing is, neither of the former child stars has forgotten where they came from. From Ariana's dino-inspired artwork to the pair of them both sharing throwback photos of their early acting days on Instagram, it's clear they appreciate where they started.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And unlike many other child stars, they don't seem to have any horror stories to tell about their time on set with Steven Spielberg or their castmates.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Top 10 Highest-Grossing Movies Worldwide, From 20 Years Ago</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZ2imnqivsRmq6GdXaC2pb%2BMn6mopV2fwrOt0qygnGWglr%2Bsec2ormg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./steve-harris-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Steve Harris Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./does-tommy-dreamer-have-an-eating-disorder-209621-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Does Tommy Dreamer Have An Eating Disorder?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-leroux-car-accident-update-death-and-cause-news-gone-viral.html>Ava Leroux Car Accident Update: Death And Cause News Gone Viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./baby-smoove-net-worth.html>Baby Smoove Net Worth How Much is Baby Smoove Worth?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./james-remar.html>James Remar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenyon-martin-basketballplayer-htm.html>Kenyon Martin Jr - Biography, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-durant-wiki-height-weight-age-girlfriend-family-biography-more.html>Kevin Durant Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ.
