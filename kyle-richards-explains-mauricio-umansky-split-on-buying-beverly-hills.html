It’s not like they can film that scene [for Buying Beverly Hills] and then I don’t share it with the viewers of the Housewives,” she noted. “We ended up shooting both of those scenes for Buying Beverly Hills and The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills after we were all wrapped.”</p><p>Us Weekly originally confirmed <a href=#>Richards and Umansky’s separation</a> in July 2023. During season 13 of RHOBH, Richards hinted at issues in her marriage but it wasn’t until pickup scenes in the finale that viewers saw the couple <a href=#>candidly discuss their decision to part ways.</a></p><p>“There were things that happened that made me lose my trust that I wasn’t able to recover from,” Richards said on the February 21 episode. “It just felt like my whole life was over in that moment. The life as I knew it.”</p><p>Buying Beverly Hills, which focuses on Umansky’s real estate company, has released several clips <a href=#>hinting at the split being a major story line.</a></p><p>“I had an amazing 26 years with your mom. An amazing 26 years. I wanted to do everything possible to just save it. So your mom came and she talked to me. And she said, ‘I think I need space,'” Umansky, 53, told his and Richards’ kids, Farrah, 35, Alexia, 27, Sophia, 23, and Portia, 15, in the first official look at season 2 of Buying Beverly Hills.</p><p>He continued: “She said to me, ‘Listen, the rules are that you go out, you date, you do whatever it is you want to do. I’m not going to be asking you what you’re doing. I don’t want you to be asking me what I’m doing. Like we are separated.'”</p><p>After news broke about their separation, Umansky and Richards denied in a joint statement that infidelity played a role in their decision. Richards noted on Thursday’s Amazon Live that the pair are now <a href=#>allowed to date other people</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“That’s a big question. We’re allowed to,” Richards, who has denied dating her friend country singer <strong>Morgan Wade,</strong> added. “We’re allowed to do what we want.”</p><p>According to Richards, there have also been discussions about moving out of their shared home. “Yes, that’s a conversation that’s happening,” she said. “We’re fortunate that we don’t fight, and we get along, so it actually oddly works.”</p><p>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills airs Wednesdays on Bravo at 8 p.m. ET. Season 2 of Buying Beverly Hills drops on Netflix on March 22.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKypJViv6qvx5qpnatdmsWxuMCipaxlnZbCs7XCoqZmrZ2Wu7S32GaqqaSZqXqwuoybrLKhnpx6o7HVnqmlsV2dtq240mg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./210708-meet-claws-star-niecy-nashs-two-beautifu-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Meet 'Claws' Star Niecy Nash's 2 Beautiful Daughters and Her Son</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-clee-nyc-restaurant-in-and-just-like-that-a-real-place-filming-locations-explained.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is Clee NYC Restaurant In And Just Like That A Real Place?
