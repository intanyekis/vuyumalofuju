In the 13 years of being on RHOBH I have never felt so much love and support,” Kyle, 54, wrote via her Instagram Story on Monday, December 18. “I wish I could respond to each and every one of you, but I do want you to know that I am reading your messages and I want to thank you for taking the time to share your insight, support and wisdom with me. I appreciate it more than you know.”</p><p>She continued: “It also makes me happy to know that many of you feel inspired by my choice not to drink alcohol and in sharing that with me you inspire me to stay on my path. Sending love to you all ❤️.”</p><p>During the <a href=#>Wednesday, December 13, episode</a> of RHOBH, which was filmed late last year, Kyle got emotional while discussing the loss of her “very, very, very best friend” Lorene Shea, who died by suicide in May 2022.</p><p>“I don’t know what happened, because she was so together,” Kyle told her therapist. “I mean, literally, in my will, she was in charge of my children, my money, my everything. She was so together and then all of a sudden — I don’t know what happened. I don’t have answers. it’s so frustrating to me.”</p><p>Kyle stated that she was focused on surrounding herself with “people that I love and love me, support me and only want the best for me and I only want the best for them” after Lorene’s death, adding, “I’m just trying to do all the things that are going to make me feel stronger. It’s been working.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Kyle-Richards-Gets-Emotional-Remembering-Late-Best-Friend-Lorene-Shea-3.jpg><p>In a previous episode, Kyle opened up about her decision to stop drinking alcohol, revealing that she “cannot afford to feel depressed right now,” alluding to the challenges she was facing in her personal life. She marked <a href=#>one year of sobriety</a> in July.</p><p>Kyle’s relationship with her estranged husband, <strong>Mauricio Umansky</strong>, has also drawn attention this season. When news broke of <a href=#>their separation</a> in July after 27 years of marriage, Kyle and Mauricio, 53, clarified in a <a href=#>joint statement</a> that there was “no wrongdoing on anyone’s part.” They have since been spotted together several times, with Kyle <a href=#>cheering for Mauricio</a> as he competed on Dancing With the Stars this fall.</p><p>Fans caught a glimpse of the pair’s tension during the <a href=#>season 13 RHOBH premiere</a>, which aired in October. Kyle clapped back after getting two new tattoos, which prompted Mauricio to tell her he “will not allow” her to get any more. “You didn’t even know how many I had. … If I want one I’m going to get one. It’s my body,” she told him.</p><p>In subsequent episodes, Kyle referred to Mauricio’s real estate company, The Agency, as <a href=#>“the other woman”</a> in their marriage and admitted to costar <strong>Dorit Kemsley</strong> that <a href=#>she was “not happy”</a> in her relationship. “I’m, sort of, now working on myself inside and I feel like he’s very focused on his work,” Kyle confessed. “So, I feel like in that aspect we’re kind of growing in different directions.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Kyle-Richards-Thanks-Fans-Amid-Season-13-Ups-and-Downs-3.jpg><p>Despite their struggles, Kyle revealed earlier this month that she and Mauricio will be <a href=#>spending Christmas together</a> with their kids. “We get along,” she told <a href=# rel=noopener>TMZ</a> on December 4. “We’re just taking everything a day at a time.” (Kyle and Mauricio share daughters Alexia, 27, Sophia, 23, and Portia, 15. Mauricio is also stepfather to Kyle’s daughter Farrah, 35, whom she shares with ex-husband <strong>Guraish Aldjufrie</strong>.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills airs on Bravo Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, call the <a href=# rel=noopener>National Suicide Prevention Lifeline</a> at 988.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKypJViv6qvx5qpnatdqbWiusqsZJ%2BZnqh6p7vRZqOorpVirq%2BwjKysqaifp8FurcWtnKtllqe2prrDrGSdnZGptXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mariah-simone-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-170050-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mariah Simone Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./j-prince-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>J Prince Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-leroux-car-accident-update-death-and-cause-news-gone-viral.html>Ava Leroux Car Accident Update: Death And Cause News Gone Viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./baby-smoove-net-worth.html>Baby Smoove Net Worth How Much is Baby Smoove Worth?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./james-remar.html>James Remar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenyon-martin-basketballplayer-htm.html>Kenyon Martin Jr - Biography, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-durant-wiki-height-weight-age-girlfriend-family-biography-more.html>Kevin Durant Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ.
