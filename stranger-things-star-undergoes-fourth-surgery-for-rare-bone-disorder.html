His character, Dustin Henderson, has a lisp caused by Cleidocranial Dysplasia, a rare genetic disorder he was born with that affects the growth of his teeth and bones. Matarazzo, who actually has&nbsp;the disease, is undergoing his fourth surgery.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 17-year-old actor didn't give many details regarding the surgery but called the&nbsp;operation a "big one" on his latest Instagram post. He urged his followers to learn more about Cleidocranial Dysplasia at the <a href=#>CCD Smiles</a> website.</p><p>Matarazzo received plenty of&nbsp;love from&nbsp;fans and celebrity friends. His 'Stranger Things' co-star Millie Bobby Brown showed her support commenting on his Instagram post.</p><p>"Good luck love!!!" she wrote. "Sending my love gate."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>20 Photos Of Millie Bobby Brown's Evolution Since Season 1 Of Stranger Things</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to the <a href=#>U.S. Department of Health & Human Services</a>, Cleidocranial Dysplasia (CCD) is a condition that primarily affects the development of the bones and teeth. Characteristic features include underdeveloped or absent collarbones, dental abnormalities, and delayed closing of spaces between the skull bones.</p><p>Unfortunately, there isn't a&nbsp;cure for CCD but it can be managed by dental procedures, treatment of sinus and ear infections, use of helmets for high-risk activities, and/or surgery for skeletal problems.</p><p>Matarazzo opened up about the&nbsp;rare disorder&nbsp;during an appearance on&nbsp;The Doctors&nbsp;in 2018 and explained how it was written into the science-fiction Netflix series.</p><p>"I think what The Duffer Brothers, the directors of the show, really wanted to do, they wanted to make sure each character in the show was unique, and they had something that was realistic and personal," he shared. "They didn't want cookie-cutter; they wanted unique characters that were relatable and were different."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"So when they heard I had the condition, I told them... when I was just stretching in the audition room," he continued, adding that casting directors noticed his shoulders were touching. "I was like, 'Yeah, I was born without collarbones.' I started explaining what it was, and how I had a condition from birth. And that it affects my teeth and everything, and that's why I was missing teeth the first season."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Matarazzo revealed that once he got the part of Dustin Henderson, the Duffer Brothers were inspired by the condition and told him they were going to incorporate&nbsp;Cleidocranial Dysplasia into his character's storyline.</p><p>"They used it in a realistic way," he said. "They asked me if it was OK if the kids in the show had bullied me because of it. And I said, 'That's totally cool. It's realistic."</p><p>Matarazzo shared that he lost roles to the condition early in his career due to his teeth and lisp.&nbsp; "That's one of the biggest reasons why I haven't been getting roles," he said. "I would go three times a week up for auditions and just 'No' constantly."</p><p>Whatever casting directors said "no" to the Stranger Things star are probably regretting that decision. The fact that the Duffer Brothers saw his condition as an inspiration&nbsp;instead of an inconvenience, says a lot about the uniqueness they wanted to bring to the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Did You Catch These 20 Easter Eggs From Stranger Things?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqraqRo7Smvoytn6Kml6h6tMDAq2SuppSav6i7xKxkn6elp8GpedKuqaCdoq56p7vRZqmaqpVir7C6xGaboqufp7Gmvo4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./taylor-fritz-girlfriend-morgan-riddle-met-on-dating-app-raya.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Did Taylor Fritz Meet His Girlfriend Morgan Riddle On The Exclusive Raya App?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./wanya-marcal-leicester-brothers.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Wanya Marcals first Leicester City goal was very much a family affair</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-leroux-car-accident-update-death-and-cause-news-gone-viral.html>Ava Leroux Car Accident Update: Death And Cause News Gone Viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./baby-smoove-net-worth.html>Baby Smoove Net Worth How Much is Baby Smoove Worth?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./james-remar.html>James Remar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenyon-martin-basketballplayer-htm.html>Kenyon Martin Jr - Biography, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-durant-wiki-height-weight-age-girlfriend-family-biography-more.html>Kevin Durant Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ.
