They were directors, they were producers. It was a situation where I thought I was surrounded by, I thought I was safe,” he explained. “I thought, ‘OK, I thought the cancer had been carved out. We’re better now.’ And I had no idea that for four years, I was working alongside people who had supported him, and probably in the back of their mind were thinking of me in a certain way, and I thought they were my friends.”</p><p>Peck, 63,<a href=#> was arrested in August 2003</a> for sexually abusing a then-unnamed child. Peck pleaded no contest to performing a lewd act with a victim around 14 or 15 years old and to oral copulation with a child under 16 years old, which resulted in a 16-month prison sentence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Drake-Bell-Didnt-Know-He-Worked-With-Brian-Peck-Supporters-5.jpg><p>The directors behind Quiet on Set, <strong>Mary Robertson </strong>and<strong> Emma Schwartz</strong>, were able to unseal the letters of support in the case, which was mentioned in the third and fourth installment of the doc. Some of the names and letters featured included <strong>Rider Strong, Will Friedle, James Marsden</strong> and director <strong>Thomas DeSanto</strong>. (Strong, 44, Friedle, 47, and DeSanto, 56, <a href=#>have since walked back their support</a> for Peck.)</p><p><strong>Taran Killam </strong>and<strong> Kimmy Robertson</strong>, were notable names <a href=#>because they appeared on Drake & Josh</a> after asking the judge to grant Peck probation instead of prison time.</p><p>In the doc, Business Insider journalist <strong>Kate Taylor</strong> said it was unclear how much Peck’s friends knew about the charges being brought up against him at the time. Bell, for his part, noted on Friday’s podcast that some of the people who wrote letters were in the courtroom — and as a result <a href=#>knew his identity and were aware of the charges</a> against Peck.</p><p>“To sit there and say, ‘Yes, I did this, but it’s not how they’re painting it.’ I mean, I can’t imagine [Peck] framing it in a way where 41 people, adults, say ‘Oh, well that totally makes sense, how you’re telling me, that makes sense,’” Bell added on Friday about how he questioned people’s decision to <a href=#>advocate for Peck after he admitted</a> to molesting a minor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Drake-Bell-Didnt-Know-He-Worked-With-Brian-Peck-Supporters-4.jpg><p>In Robertson’s letter to the judge, which was shown in the docuseries, she wrote, “I believe with all my heart that Brian was pressured and pushed beyond belief before he caved in.” Robertson, who appeared in Peck’s 1990 movie The Willies, has continued to post photos with the dialogue coach as recently as 2021.</p><p>Killam, 41, meanwhile, referred to Peck’s arrest as “too out of character.”</p><p>“When I found out about Brian being arrested I was shocked. Brian is the last person I would expect to be charged with criminal activities. My first thought was, ‘This is a mistake.’ I know many of our mutual friends had similar thoughts,” he wrote in his letter. “I have seen the effects this situation has had on Brian and I know for a fact that he regrets any mistakes made and that this is certainly not something that would ever happen again.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Drake-Bell-Didnt-Know-He-Worked-With-Brian-Peck-Supporters-3.jpg><p>Killam concluded: There has yet to be a set that I work on, where someone doesn’t know Brian, and also doesn’t think the world of him. He honestly is one of the most well liked, well-respected people in this business.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>According to Bell, he hasn’t spoken to anyone who supported Peck publicly or privately, adding on Friday, “I haven’t gotten an apology, or a sorry, from anybody that had written letters, or was involved in supporting him at all.”</p><p>Us Weekly has previously reached out to Robertson and Killam for comment and the other actors who wrote letters featured in the doc.</p><p><i>If you or someone you know has been sexually assaulted, contact the </i><a href=# rel=noopener><i>National Sexual Assault Hotline</i></a><i> at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673).</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJurmZuaeqOxy6VknaGUo8Fut82ormaaop6ur3nPnpqkq12bv6qxzZ2qZq%2Bfp7imsIyopWacopa4pnnAp5tmop%2BotXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./is-nle-choppa-black-or-white.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is NLE Choppa Black Or White?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1339586-dominik-mysterio-reflects-on-his-babyface-character-says-hes-more-comfortable-as-a-heel.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dominik Mysterio Reflects On His Babyface Character, Says Hes More Comfortable As A Heel</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-leroux-car-accident-update-death-and-cause-news-gone-viral.html>Ava Leroux Car Accident Update: Death And Cause News Gone Viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./baby-smoove-net-worth.html>Baby Smoove Net Worth How Much is Baby Smoove Worth?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./james-remar.html>James Remar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenyon-martin-basketballplayer-htm.html>Kenyon Martin Jr - Biography, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-durant-wiki-height-weight-age-girlfriend-family-biography-more.html>Kevin Durant Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ.
