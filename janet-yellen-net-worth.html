Janet is best known in the world of economics, currently serving as a Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System since 3rd February 2014. She has been active since 1971.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Janet Yellen is? According to sources it has been estimated that Janet Yellen`s overall net worth is $13 million, an amount she has acquired through her successful involvement in the economy.</p><h3>Janet Yellen Net Worth $13 Million</h3><p>Janet was raised in a Jewish family; her father was a physician, originally from the town of Suwalki, Poland. Regarding her education, Janet attended the Fort Hamilton High School, situated in Bay Ridge, a southwest part of Brooklyn, following which in 1963 Yellen became a student at Brown University, from which she graduated summa cum laude in 1967 with a degree in Economics. After that she enrolled at Yale University, and earned a PhD degree in 1971; her thesis was entitled “Employment, output and capital accumulation in an open economy: a disequilibrium approach”.</p><p>Janet`s first job was as an assistant professor at the prestigious Harvard University, working there from 1971 until 1976. After that, she spent two years abroad, working as a lecturer at the London School of Economics and Political Science, from 1978 until 1980. Janet then decided to return to USA, and soon found engagement at the University Of California, Berkeley. These positions all contributed steadily to her growing net worth.</p><p>However, Janet left her job at Berkeley in 1994, to serve on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, which increased her net worth to a large degree. In 1997, Yellen`s net worth gained another boost, as she was appointed as Chair of President <a href=#>Bill Clinton`s</a> Council of Economic Advisers until 1999.</p><p>Janet then returned to economics and finance, and in 2004 she was hired as president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, staying in that position until 2010, further increasing her net worth. While serving in that position, Janet reviewed the country`s economics to the last detail, which resulted in her ability to forecast the 2008 economic crisis.</p><p>Thanks to her remarkable skills, in 2010, Yellen was promoted to the Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve, succeeding Donald Kohn, as she won the voting 17 to 6. She spent four years as a Vice Chair, and in 2014 she was approved as the Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, when President <a href=#>Barack Obama</a> nominated her to succeed <a href=#>Ben Bernanke</a> in that position. Thanks to that outcome, Janet became the first women in that position, and the first member of the Democratic Party since Paul Volcker, who was appointed as Chairman of the Federal Reserve in 1979.</p><p>Due to her tremendous accomplishments throughout her career, Janet has been awarded numerous prestigious accolades, including an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Brown in 1998, in October 2010 she received the Adam Smith Award from the National Association for Business Economics, and an honorary Doctor of Social Science degree from Yale in 2015 Furthermore, the magazine Forbes has ranked her as the second most powerful woman in the world, behind <a href=#>Angela Merkel</a>.</p><p>Regarding her personal life, Janet has been married to George Akerlof since 1971, and the couple has one child, Robert Akerlof, who now works as a professor at the University of Warwick.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=4.2036585365854><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Janet Yellen</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$13 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>13th August 1946</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Brooklyn, New York USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.6&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Professor, Economist</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Education</td><td>Yale University (1971), Brown University, Pembroke College in Brown University.</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>George Akerlof (1978)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Robert Akerlof</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Anna Yellen, Julius Yellen</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>John Yellen</td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm5908572</a></td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>Adam Smith Award,</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=1><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>One of Time Magazine's Most Influential People in the World.
