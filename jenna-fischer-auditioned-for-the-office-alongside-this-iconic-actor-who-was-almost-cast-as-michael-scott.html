The sitcom lasted nine seasons along with over 200 episodes.</p><p>Despite the success of the show, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">things could've looked very different</a>, especially from a casting standpoint.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Which Cast Member Of 'The Office' Was The Most Famous Before It Premiered (Besides Steve Carell)?</a></span></p><p>As we'll come to realize, some major names had tried out for the show during its early stages. Let's just say, some of the major roles could've had a major twist.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In particular, we'll look at an intriguing audition that took place alongside <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jenna Fischer</a>, aka Pam. The iconic actor blew the room away and it is said that he actually got the part. However, due to a certain someone's availabilities, that all changed.</p><p>We wouldn't change a thing about the show, though it is interesting to think how different things could've looked.</p><h2 id=the-entire-cast-almost-looked-very-different>The Entire Cast Almost Looked Very Different</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The competition to get on the show was fierce</a>. After the show came to an end, we got some major details on what went on behind the scenes, especially when it came to the casting process.</p><p>For starters, Rainn Wilson was the first name on the audition sheet for Dwight, however, there was a slew of other names considered, not to mention that he also auditioned for Michael's role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dwight Schrute Nearly Got An 'Office' Spin-Off Show</a></span></p><p>As for Jim, his role was far from secure.</p><p>Although John Krasinski hit it out of the park, it is interesting to think about Adam Scott and what he could've brought to the character. Although he didn't get the role, he made enough of an impression to be considered for the follow-up project, 'Parks And Rec'. He became a fan favorite and regular on the show.</p><p>As it turns out, the hardest part turned out to be casting the Michael Scott character. NBC brought in several high-profile names to read for the part. One in particular pretty much had the role secured, if not for a change at the last minute.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-role-of-michael-scott-had-plenty-of-competition>The Role Of Michael Scott Had Plenty Of Competition</h2><p>According to casting director Allison Jones, finding the right candidate for the role of Michael Scott turned out to be the most difficult process. The criteria was the star needed to be over 35 and according to Uproxx, there were more than a few names in play.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The list featured so many top-tier talents</a>, including Louis C.K., Stephen Colbert, John C. Reilly, David Arquette, Eugene Levy, Jason Segal, and so many others.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How NBC Botched Steve Carell's 'The Office' Exit</a></span></p><p>It got narrowed down to two, and a certain someone really impressed, "He was available.

I knew Bob Odenkirk when I was auditioning for The Office, and we were both called. I was called to do Pam and he was called to do Michael, so we got together and practiced together.”</p><p>“[Bob] did this very funny audition where he brought in his guitar and sang along to Pam. We had worked it all out. We were going to ask if we could do it if we were paired together, but we never were.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ultimately, Jones stated that saying no to Bob was downright gut-wrenching, given how great and respected he was. The difference at the end of the day was the fact that Bob played the role a little edgier and darker compared to Steve.</p><p>"He had an edge to him. His take was as funny as Steve’s, but it was darker."</p><p>We can all agree, the correct decision was made, and don't feel bad for Odenkirk, as he thrived in 'Breaking Bad', which in turn, would lead down the path to his very own spin-off, 'Better Call Saul'.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Does Bob Odenkirk Still Have A Recording Of A Legendary Actor Yelling At Him?</a></span></p><p>Sources: Uproxx, EW & Floor 8</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqaelnqntdKcn56qXZbCpbXToqannZRis7C%2BjK2fnmWfm7Oqr8RmmKWnnpzAqrDEZquhoaNitqS7zaKaZpmTqbyzedahpmavkah6orjMqKqtZZOWwLV5wKxkpqGTna6muIysmqispGQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./karent-sierra-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Karent Sierra Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hybes-staff-shocking-social-media-update-leaves-fans-heartbroken.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>HYBE's Staff Shocking Social Media Update Leaves Fans Heartbroken</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-leroux-car-accident-update-death-and-cause-news-gone-viral.html>Ava Leroux Car Accident Update: Death And Cause News Gone Viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./baby-smoove-net-worth.html>Baby Smoove Net Worth How Much is Baby Smoove Worth?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./james-remar.html>James Remar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenyon-martin-basketballplayer-htm.html>Kenyon Martin Jr - Biography, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-durant-wiki-height-weight-age-girlfriend-family-biography-more.html>Kevin Durant Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ.
