In 1989, the Detroit Lions made him the 3rd overall pick of the NFL Draft behind Troy Aikman and Tony Mandarich.</p><p>Despite his success in college and his high draft position, Sanders did not sign all that impressive of an entry-level contact. His first deal with the Lions was a rookie contract that was renegotiated. <strong>The contract included a $2.1 million signing bonus and was worth $7.6 million over 6 years.</strong></p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Barry Sanders</p></th><th scope=col><p>Year Signed</p></th><th scope=col><p>Years</p></th><th scope=col><p>Total Contact</p></th><th scope=col><p>Average Per Year</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>Renegotiated</p></td><td><p>1989</p></td><td><p>6</p></td><td><p>$7.6 Million</p></td><td><p>$1,266,667</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Extension</p></td><td><p>1993</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>$13,159,500</p></td><td><p>$4,386,500</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Extension</p></td><td><p>1997</p></td><td><p>5</p></td><td><p>$32,700,000</p></td><td><p>$6,540,000</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before Sanders' rookie contract was up, he signed an extension with the Lions. This deal, for 3 years and $13.1 million, provided him with a big raise. <strong>The contract paid him an average of $4,386,500 and made him the highest-paid running back in the league and the third-highest-paid player in the NFL.</strong> The only players who made more were John Elway and Steve Young.</p><p>Sanders signed his final contract extension with the Lions in 1997. This was initially a 5-year contract worth $32.7 million. Again, the contract made the running back one of the highest-paid players in the league, but he would only play two seasons on the contract before his retirement prior to the 1999 season.</p><p><strong>The contract involved an $11 million bonus that was paid out at the beginning of the deal.</strong> Upon his retirement, the Lions attempted to recoup more than $7 million of that amount. In the end, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an arbiter ordered the running back to pay the team $1.8 million</a>. Throughout his career, Sanders made $33.8 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sanders-lined-up-numerous-endorsement-deals-during-his-career><strong>Sanders Lined Up Numerous Endorsement Deals During His Career</strong></h2><h3 id=the-running-back-worked-with-companies-like-nike-and-gatorade>The running back worked with companies like Nike and Gatorade</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/mixcollage-14-feb-2024-09-51-am-1631.jpg><p>During his career, Barry Sanders endorsed some of the most recognized companies in the world. His biggest deal was with sneaker Giant Nike. In 2019, Nike commemorated the 20-year anniversary of his retirement by releasing 2,053 pairs of the Air Zoom Turf 97. Sanders had rushed for 2,053 yards during his 1997 campaign.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to Nike, Sanders also had agreements with several food and beverage companies. He stumped for both Pepsi and Gatorade and also had a deal with Frito-Lay during his playing career. Sanders <a href=#>didn't earn the same kind of endorsement money as Michael Jordan</a>, but his sponsorships paid him an additional estimated $2 million per year during his playing days.</p><p>Sanders has also had a long relationship with EA Sports that continues to this day. The running back never appeared on the cover of a Madden football game during his playing career, as John Madden appeared on the cover until 2001. But in 2014, the 25th anniversary of the game, Barry Sanders was named the cover athlete.</p><p>Sanders is still in demand as a spokesperson to this day. In 2021, the running back agreed to a deal with Bet MGM. The multi-year deal will pay him to both appear in ad campaigns and also make appearances as a brand ambassador.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sanders-has-created-an-impressive-business-career-since-leaving-the-league><strong>Sanders Has Created An Impressive Business Career Since Leaving The League</strong></h2><h3 id=the-ex-lion-invested-his-pro-earnings-intelligently>The ex-Lion invested his pro earnings intelligently</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/mixcollage-14-feb-2024-09-24-am-2370.jpg><p>Many players leave the sport of football, where they are making huge money, and squander their fortune quickly. That didn't happen to Barry Sanders, though, as the running back has been very smart with how he's invested the money he earned in football.</p><p>The former football player has used his assets to purchase real estate, owning apartment buildings and investment properties. He has also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lent his name to Oklahoma area Nissan dealerships</a> and is a spokesperson for Lefty's Cheesecakes franchises.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Currently, Sanders is working with EA Sports, the game maker that put him on the cover of its Madden 2014 football game. He <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">works for EA along with his son, Barry J. Sanders</a>. The two have paired as ratings adjusters, helping to boost the video game capabilities of players who excel on the field.</p><p>Sanders is also able to generate income based on fans' continued interest in him. In November 2023, Amazon Prime released a documentary called Bye Bye Barry which details how he retired despite still being at the top of his game.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/marcus-jordan-and-larsa-pippen.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Marcus Jordan And Larsa Pippen Call It Quits After He Claimed His Dad Would Be His Best Man</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Michael Jordan never approved of his son dating the ex-wife of his legendary teammate, Scottie Pippen.
