When his parents left to take their dogs out for his walk several hours later, Kingston seemingly stayed behind. When they returned, he was no longer in the house. Skerrett’s inquest reported that Kingston was found in a locked outbuilding “with a catastrophic head injury.”</p><p class=p1>Further details about Kingston’s death have not been shared, but Skerrett noted that a gun “was present at the scene.”</p><p class=p1>News broke earlier this week that Thomas, who was married to <strong>Lady Gabriella Kingston</strong>, had <a href=#>died on Sunday</a> at the age of 45.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/homas-Kingston-Died-From-Gunshot-Wound-to-the-Head.jpg><p class=p1>“It is with the deepest sorrow that we announce the death of Thomas Kingston, our beloved husband, son and brother,” Gabriella, 42, and her family said in a statement to <i>Us Weekly </i>on Tuesday, February 27. “Tom was an exceptional man who lit up the lives of all who knew him. His death has come as a great shock to the whole family and we ask you to respect our privacy as we mourn his passing.”</p><p class=p1>Gabriella, for her part, is a member of the royal family. She is the daughter of the Prince and Princess Michael of Kent, who were cousins of the late Queen Elizabeth II.
