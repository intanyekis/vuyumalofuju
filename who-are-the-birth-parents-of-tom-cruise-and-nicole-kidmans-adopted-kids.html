For years, the couple tried to get pregnant and Nicole even suffered multiple pregnancy losses. The first was when she was only 23-years-old and a newlywed. She suffered an ectopic pregnancy. Nicole has admitted to also trying IVF, with no success.</p><p>Nicole later suffered another loss nearly a decade later, shortly before divorcing Tom. The pair had already adopted their son and daughter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I had a miscarriage at the end of my marriage, but I had an ectopic pregnancy at the beginning of my marriage. It was incredibly traumatic for me. Sometimes you share your grief,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole said to Marie Claire in 2007</a>.</p><p>At the time, the actress said she was still hopeful about having a successful pregnancy. “What will be will be. It’s in God’s hands,” she added. Only a year later, the actress gave birth to a daughter, Sunday, in 2008. This was her first child with her husband, country singer Keith Urban, whom she married in 2006.</p><p>The couple later welcomed a second daughter, Faith, via gestational surrogate in 2010. The baby is biologically Nicole and Keith’s.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Is Tom Cruise And Nicole Kidman's Daughter Isabella Jane Doing Now?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite now being a mother-of-four, Nicole hasn’t been afraid to lament on her difficult journey to motherhood. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">More recently, the actress shared</a>, “I know the yearning. That yearning. It’s a huge, aching yearning. And the loss! The loss of a miscarriage is not talked about enough. That’s massive grief to certain women.”</p><p>“There’s an enormous amount of pain and an enormous amount of joy on the other side of it,” Nicole said of finally becoming a mother. “The flip side of going through so much yearning and pain to get there is the feeling of ‘Ahhhh!’ when you have the child.”</p><p>For his part, Tom also went on to have a biological child following his divorce from Nicole. He welcomed a daughter, Suri, with actress Katie Holmes in 2006. The pair were married from 2006 to 2012, only to divorce in a matter of weeks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Various reports claim that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom hasn’t seen his youngest daughter in years</a>.

Connor briefly dabbled in acting, with appearances in films like Seven Pounds and Red Dawn, and he’s now a DJ. Isabella is even more out of the public eye. She’s an artist as well as an auditor for the Church of Scientology.</p><p>Due to their private nature, there’s not a lot known about Isabella and Connor’s personal lives. They’re not biological siblings, as they have different birth parents.

However, the same can’t be said for their relationship with Nicole.

They’re now also active members of the Church of Scientology, just like their famous father.</p><p>There’s speculation that Tom’s scientology beliefs fuelled his divorce from Nicole, just like it seemingly played a part in his split from Katie.
