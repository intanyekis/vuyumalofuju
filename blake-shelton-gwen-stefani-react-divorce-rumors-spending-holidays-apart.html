[But] you sometimes want to... not be the host," the pop star continued. "So I was like, 'Eh, I'm gonna do it.'

Friends are worried that if they don’t address their problems before they spiral out of control, divorce might be in the cards for them.”</p><p>“There isn’t much for them to talk about,” the insider continued. “She can put on cowboy boots and sing a country duet with Blake, but Gwen doesn’t really fit in that whole country lifestyle. When she’s in Oklahoma, she misses L.A. and all its conveniences.”</p><p>Even if Stefani and Shelton are facing martial problems, their recent public appearance seems to suggest they’re maintaining a united front.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZpZmbmnq0tMSlq6imXZzEprqMrKuenpGjtm6%2BxJqarWWUnsOwvsKeZKutnaS%2FtHnSqZynnJmjtG60zqWgnZmpqHqivMCrq2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./corning-plans-50-million-expansion-midland-plant-r.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Corning plans $50 million expansion at Midland plant WSOC TV</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./michigan-qb-jj-mccarthy-looks-to-hindu-meditatio.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Remarkable!
