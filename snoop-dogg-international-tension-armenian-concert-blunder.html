I’m bringing love and peace and wishing everyone strength. Im coming, September 23rd!!!!!!”</p><p>Artsakh is a breakaway state on the border of Eastern Europe and West Asia, whose territory is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan — which has been locked in a long-running and at times bloody dispute with Armenia over control of the region.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>In the late 1980s, the <a href=# rel=noopener>Nagorno-Karabakh conflict</a> resulted in roughly thirty thousand casualties and hundreds of thousands of refugees, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>Global Conflict Tracker</a>.</p><p>Even after a ceasefire was declared in 1994, fighting between Armenian and Azerbaijani troops broke out again in late 2020, while in recent months blockades have been installed, limiting travel and supplies into Artsakh.</p><p>Tensions still remain high between both countries, as evidenced by the outrage in the comments section on Snoop Dogg’s post.</p><p>“For years, the Azerbaijani territory was occupied by Armenia, and now you want to say that Artsakh is Armenia?” one angry Azerbaijani fan wrote.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“This shows that you do not know anything about the country that has occupied OUR AZERBAIJANI territories for over 30 years, in which you are holding a concert, shame and disgrace, money will not cover your conscience! Karabakh is Azerbaijan!”</p><p>Another added: “How much did they pay you to write this nonsense? That place you wrote doesn’t exist and never existed. It has always been Karabakh, part of Azerbaijan and always will be!</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“If you truly want to help people in need, you should be helping everyone, no matter what background they have! You’re only spreading hate, creating separation and division between people.”</p><p>Someone else even threatened legal action against Tha Doggfather for his geographical gaffe, warning him: “Respect the international law, otherwise you will be sued! #noartsakh there is no any Artsakh on the political map of the World.”</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/09/snoop-dogg-responds-after-stephen-a-smith-pokes-fun-at-his-skinny-physique-250x142.jpg alt="Snoop Dogg Responds After Stephen A.
