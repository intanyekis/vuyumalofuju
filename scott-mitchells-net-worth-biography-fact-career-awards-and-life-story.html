Scott Mitchell was born in Salt Lake City, Utah in January 1968. He played his college football at Utah as a quarterback. He was selected #93 by the Miami Dolphins in the 1990 NFL Draft.

He was injured and replaced by Dave Krieg. Offensive tackle Lomas Brown later admitted to missing a block on purpose that resulted in Mitchell’s injury because Brown was upset with Mitchell’s quality of play.

Scott played in 1999 for the Baltimore Ravens and finished his career with the Cincinnati Bengals from 2000 to 2001.
