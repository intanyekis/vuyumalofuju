Tom Cruise & Katie Holmes - $3 Million</h2><p>Dropping millions of dollars on a wedding didn’t mean a thing for these two wealthy actors. The wedding took place in 2006 in a beautiful 15th-century Italian castle. Katie sported not one, but two Giorgio Armani wedding dresses decorated with Swarovski crystals. The entire wedding party also wore the designer’s expensive clothing for the couple’s Italian nuptials.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Strict Scientology Pregnancy Rules Tom Cruise Made Katie Holmes Follow</a></span></p><p>The guest list included Jennifer Lopez and Will Smith, and also fellow Scientologists Leah Remini and John Travolta.

The talented actress and one of the richest men in France had a long guest list that included Anna Wintour, Charlize Theron, singer Bono, Penelope Cruz, and many more.</p><p>This wedding proved to be as star-studded as they come. Married in Venice at the La Fenice Theater (the location alone most likely was what made the wedding so pricey),&nbsp;<a style=font-size:16px href=#>Salma</a> walked down the aisle in an exquisite Balenciaga gown behind the pair’s 19-month old daughter, who was the flower girl.</p><h2 id=george-clooney-amp-amal-alamuddin---4-6-million>8. George Clooney & Amal Alamuddin - $4.6 Million</h2><p>The $4.6 million wedding of the wildly popular actor and the human rights attorney was held in Italy in 2014.&nbsp;<a href=#>Amal’s custom-made</a> Oscar de la Renta gown may have cost a few hundred thousand dollars, but the bulk of the outrageous cost of their wedding was spent on renting out rooms for the A-list guests.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These included John Krasinski, Matt Damon, and Cindy Crawford, just to name a few.

Justin Timberlake & Jessica Biel - $6.5 Million</h2><p>When this&nbsp;<a href=#>bride and groom</a> wed in 2012, it had millions of teenage girls fuming. The couple decided to tie the knot in Italy (a popular celebrity wedding location) at the Borgo Egnazia, a centuries-old 63-room castle converted into a hotel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>20 Reasons Jessica Biel and Justin Timberlake Will Never Have To Call A Divorce Lawyer</a></span></p><p>Only a mere 150 guests attended the event, but the guest list did include hip-hop artist Timbaland, actor and comedian Andy Samberg, and other exclusive celebrities. The cost of tight security, fireworks, and a pink Giambattista Valli wedding gown greatly contributed to the multi-million dollar wedding budget.</p><h2 id=wayne-rooney-amp-coleen-mcloughlin---8-million>5. Wayne Rooney & Coleen McLoughlin - $8 Million</h2><p>Although the groom would have much rather tied the knot at a quick Vegas wedding, his bride had other costly plans. The&nbsp;<a href=#>Manchester United</a> soccer player and his wife wed at an Italian church in front of only 65 guests, which included family, friends, and half of Rooney’s teammates.</p><p>Coleen wore three dresses designed by New York design house Marchesa for her big day. One gown was for the wedding ceremony, one for the religious ceremony, and the final dress for the reception. Each guest was gifted an extravagant set of rosary beads.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=michael-jordan-amp-yvette-prieto---10-million>4. Michael Jordan & Yvette Prieto - $10 Million</h2><p>When one of the&nbsp;<a href=#>greatest basketball players</a> of all time married model Yvette Prieto, there was no chance it was going to be cheap. The ceremony was held at a church in Florida near Jordan’s mansion, and the guest list was filled with current and retired NBA players. Yvette’s silk strapless gown was designed by J’Aton Couture and featured Swarovski crystals throughout the dress.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Yvette Prieto Net Worth</a></span></p><p>The evening’s “light entertainment” included performances by Robin Thicke and Usher.

Kim Kardashian & Kris Humphries - $10 Million</h2><p>Kim Kardashian’s second marriage to NBA player Kris Humphries ended in divorce after a mere 72 days, but they sure didn’t scrimp on their wedding. Reportedly spending around $10 million total, the black-and-white themed wedding included a high profile guest list including Robin Thicke, Demi Lovato, and Ryan Seacrest, to name only a few.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kris Humphries Obsessed With Kim Kardashian</a></span></p><p><a href=#>Kim had not only one</a> custom made Vera Wang dress, but three in total: one for the ceremony and the other two for the reception afterward.

Prince William & Kate Middleton - $34 Million</h2><p>A&nbsp;<a href=#>royal wedding</a> is bound to have a hefty price tag, but we didn’t imagine it to be THIS high.

This wedding cost substantially more than Prince Harry’s older brother’s wedding, who is 2nd in line to the throne. Also viewed by millions of people, the wedding took place at St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle.</p><p>Although security was the majority of the reason for the wedding’s costly bill, the $430,000 dress and $700,000 worth of food and drinks didn’t help the steep price.
