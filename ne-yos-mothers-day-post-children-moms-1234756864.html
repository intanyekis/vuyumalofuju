On Sunday (May 14), Ne-Yo posted an Instagram slide that includes a photo of himself and his mother, as well as the women he shares children with: Monyetta Shaw<a href=#>, Crystal Renay</a>, and Sade Bagnerise.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Happy Mother’s Day to my amazing mom, my nephew’s crazy mom (hey sis) and the beautiful mothers of my beautiful children,” the hitmaker wrote in the post’s caption. “My love for you is endless.” While the R&B star also shared kind words and praised mothers across the globe, his post garnered critiques from those who found it classless for him to include his ex-wife and the woman he allegedly cheated on her with in the same post.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“It’s the audacity to post all the baby moms in one post that’s absolutely absurd,” one user wrote. Others also noted how each woman was presented in the post, with many taking issue with Ne-Yo’s photo choice for Bagnerise. “Not only are all the pics classy except hers, but everyone was tagged but her. I hope she don’t think she won,” another commenter added. In contrast, others praised the singer for including all of the mothers of his children in the post and not honoring one in particular.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-1409924651.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The “So Sick” creator’s love life was <a href=#>brought under scrutiny</a> last year when his ex-wife Renay filed for divorce in August 2022, citing “irretrievably broken with no hope for reconciliation.” She, who accused her then-husband of infidelity, addressed her decision to call it quits in a lengthy social media post that’s since been deleted. “8 years of lies and deception. 8 years of unknowingly sharing my life and husband with numerous of women who sell their bodies to him unprotected… every last one of them!” she wrote.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“To say I’m heartbroken and disgusted is an understatement. To ask me to stay and accept it is absolutely insane. The mentality of a narcissist. I will no longer lie to the public or pretend that this is something it isn’t. I choose me, I choose my happiness and health and my respect.” The former couple’s <a href=#>divorce was finalized</a> earlier this year, with Renay being awarded nearly $2 million in support.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Ne-Yo recently made headlines after it was revealed that he filed a petition against his ex-girlfriend, Bagnerise, questioning the paternity of one of their two children. While the 43-year-old admits that he’s the biological father of their eldest child, Braiden, he is doubtful about the paternity of the younger child, Brixton, and has demanded a DNA test. In addition to the paternity test, he’s also seeking joint custody, a “liberal parenting schedule,” and for Braiden to take on his last name.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">See Ne-Yo’s Mother’s Day tribute below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OybsXOrGSmp6SdsrO%2FjJ2YsmWgpMC1ecKhoKWcopq7brnOpqpmaWJogXiBlXFtbWc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rex-ryan-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rex Ryan Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chrishell-stause-engaged-to-g-flip-rumors.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is Chrishell Stause Engaged To G Flip?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-leroux-car-accident-update-death-and-cause-news-gone-viral.html>Ava Leroux Car Accident Update: Death And Cause News Gone Viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./baby-smoove-net-worth.html>Baby Smoove Net Worth How Much is Baby Smoove Worth?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./james-remar.html>James Remar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenyon-martin-basketballplayer-htm.html>Kenyon Martin Jr - Biography, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-durant-wiki-height-weight-age-girlfriend-family-biography-more.html>Kevin Durant Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ.
