But despite that, <a href=#>Emma remains by his side</a>.</p><p>She confessed, “The girls bring so much love, laughter, and life into our home. For us as a family, it’s always been about making memories. I’m not even sure we have rituals or traditions. We just love spending time with each other, and we know that time is precious, and I don’t take that for granted.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On their 14th wedding anniversary, Emma revealed how hard it was to be his caretaker after she received a bouquet of flowers from her friend.</p><p>She wrote on Instagram, “It got me thinking about how hard these types of ‘special occasions’ can be on caregivers. When usually our person would acknowledge the event, now their changing brains just can’t. And that is what it is. So my point is this. If you know someone that is looking after someone else, don’t ask what you can do, just do. This random act of kindness will honestly stay with me for a long time.”</p><h2 id=how-old-was-emma-heming-when-she-married-bruce-willis>How Old Was Emma Heming When She Married Bruce Willis?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The age difference between Bruce Willis and his current wife Emma Heming</a> is 23 years.
