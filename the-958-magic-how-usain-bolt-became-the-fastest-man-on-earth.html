He is considered the greatest sprinter of all time, and his charm and humor has made him a superstar athlete. Bolt has always been a sports fanatic; however, his interests were in different fields. His dedication and focus brought him to sprinting and made him the top sprinter in the world. After smashing multiple records and winning tournaments, he became the face of various brands. <a href=#>He has amassed a $90 million</a> net worth through competitions, ventures, and brand endorsements.</p><p>While Bolt always knew he would end up with a career in sports, running the track was third on the list. He has managed to become everyone’s favorite athlete from hard work and sheer will. Let’s look at the success story of the fastest human on Earth.</p><h2 id=starting-young>Starting Young</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Born in Sherwood Content in a town called Trelawny Parish in Jamaica, Usain Bolt came from a middle-class family. His parents ran a local grocery store while spending his days with his siblings. He attended the Waldensia Primary School and became the fastest runner there by the age of 12. When he attended Knibb Memorial High School, Bolt excelled in cricket and soccer; however, his fast-running speed outshone his other talents. After the persuasion of his cricket coach, Bolt tried for Track and Field, as stated by the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Olympics</a>.</p><p>His career as a track athlete started steadily as he began winning medals at high school championships around his country. After setting International Records at CARIFTA Games and Central American and Junior Caribbean Championships, the Prime Minister of Jamaica moved Bolt to Kingston to begin training with the best.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At 15, Bolt won the 200-meter race at the 2002 World Junior Championship and became the youngest world-junior gold medalist. The following year, he won four gold medals at the CARIFTA Games and set a world record at the 2003 World Youth Championships. Bolt had already begun gaining popularity in Jamaica; however, <a href=#>the world was yet to discover Usain Bolt.</a></p><h2 id=a-stroke-of-lightning-into-stardom>A Stroke Of Lightning Into Stardom</h2><p>Usain Bolt trained with coach Fitz Coleman and became a professional runner by 2004. He was awarded the Austin Sealy Trophy at the CARIFTA Games for being the Most Outstanding Player to ever play in the tournament. Despite suffering a hamstring injury, Bolt was selected to become a part of the Jamaican Olympic team for the 2004 Athens Olympics. As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, his injury came to haunt him, and he was eliminated from the first round of the 200-meter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Based on his performance at World Championships, Bolt was offered scholarships to train in the US while representing his country, but he refused out of loyalty. He studied in Jamaica at the University of Technology and continued setting records at World Championships. At the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Bolt won gold in 100-meter, 200-meter, and the 4x100-meter relay races and became the first man since Carl Lewis to achieve this feat. He also became the first-ever man to set world records in all three categories with 9.69 seconds, 19.30 seconds, and 37.10 seconds, respectively.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Martin Garrix Story: How The 'Fastest Rising' DJ Grew His Millions</a></span></p><p>He broke his 100-meter and 200-meter sprint world record at the 2009 World Championships and won two gold medals.
