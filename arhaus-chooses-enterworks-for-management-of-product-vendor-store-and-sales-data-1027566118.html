Arhaus collaborates with skilled artisans all over the world who craft its many exclusive collections, which are complemented by timeless upholstered pieces (slipcovered, leather and custom-ordered seating), indoor and outdoor dining tables and chairs, bedroom and office furniture, seasonally-inspired accessories, private label bedding, throws and accents, and more. Made of the world's finest materials (with attention to sustainability), products are presented in dramatic lifestyle settings infused with original architectural elements imported from Parisian flea markets and Tuscan villas, hand-painted murals, Arhaus Relics, or repurposed antiques, and the freshest botanicals sourced locally in each store market. Privately owned and operated, currently there 70+ stores in the U.S.</p><p>"Furnishing A Better World." This is our philosophy; it dates back to 1986 when father and son, <span class=xn-person>Jack and John Reed</span>, opened the first store location in <span class=xn-location>Cleveland</span> and vowed never to use wood from the world's endangered rainforests in the making of an Arhaus design. Today, nearly 50 percent of our collections are made of recycled material—everything from glass, to metals like copper and wood cast off from far off lands. To ensure our values are upheld, we work with artisans who share our earth-conscious values and use renewable and recycled materials when crafting pieces for our stores. Sustainably sourced timbers like teak, bamboo and mango—grown for the sole purpose of building—are used. And because we love a good story, we use reclaimed materials whenever possible, namely wood from countries tearing down dilapidated barns, shipyards and rural structures, and we refurbish one-of-a-kind antiques—we call these pieces Relics.</p><p>For more information, call 866.427.4287 or visit them on the web at <a href=# rel=nofollow>http://www.arhaus.com</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>SOURCE Enterworks</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae4psDSZ5muq5mjsrS%2FyKeqopyVp3uku8xopZ6vo2TAtbvCpKpomaKdrra%2FjJyfqKejmsBusc2tnKuvn6e4tHnFqKlmpZGjrqixzJ6lrWWfm3qxvs6drJysXauyr7DOq2SsrJ%2Bnsm6tzZ1krJmcmsBusMCtmGZpYGeEdoKVamhx</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chandler-stalcup-wiki.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chandler Stalcup Wikipedia, Age,Parents, Wife, Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./anastassia-steele-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-197980-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Anastassia Steele Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-leroux-car-accident-update-death-and-cause-news-gone-viral.html>Ava Leroux Car Accident Update: Death And Cause News Gone Viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./baby-smoove-net-worth.html>Baby Smoove Net Worth How Much is Baby Smoove Worth?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./james-remar.html>James Remar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenyon-martin-basketballplayer-htm.html>Kenyon Martin Jr - Biography, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-durant-wiki-height-weight-age-girlfriend-family-biography-more.html>Kevin Durant Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ.
