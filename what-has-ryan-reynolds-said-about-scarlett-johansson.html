Looks, however, can be deceiving. Just two years after entering into wedded bliss, the two actors who were notoriously quiet about their <a href=#>relationship that some called dysfunctional</a>, announced that they were calling it quits. There was no scandal, no ill words, and no details as to the <a href=#>truth of why they were getting a divorce</a>. All there was, was a request via a joint statement for privacy. Reynolds and Johannson even went as far as to say that they were leaving their relationship the same as how they entered it which was with "love and kindness."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Because there was no controversy with the relationship either during or after, it can be hard to remember that the Marvel stars were ever a couple, let alone married. After all, the two moved on to have happy, healthy relationships with their current spouses. It was nothing more than a starter marriage between the two that allowed the Free Guy and Lucy stars to see what they did and did not want in a spouse. As such, it is not surprising that the two do not speak of one another. And if they do, it is a once-in-a-blue-moon phenomenon, much as it recently was when Johansson spoke of Reynolds.</p><h2 id=what-scarlett-johansson-recently-said-about-ryan-reynolds>What Scarlett Johansson Recently Said About Ryan Reynolds</h2><p>Recently, Johansson was interviewed by Gwyneth Paltrow for Paltrow's podcast, Goop. In that interview, the Lost in Translation star did something that she rarely does and that is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">open up about her relationship with Reynolds</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"You've been married two times? Three times?" Paltrow asked of Johansson. To which Johansson answered that she had walked down the aisle three times.</p><p>"Oh that's right!" the Shakespeare in Love star stated. "I forgot that you were married to Ryan Reynolds! Goals!"</p><p>"Yes," Johansson stated. "We weren't married very long."</p><p>"We love a good Ryan Reynolds in our home," Paltrow commented. To which the Black Widow star replied, "He's a good guy!" And that is where the discussion regarding how Johansson feels about her ex-husband was left.</p><h2 id=scarlett-johansson-has-spoken-about-her-relationship-with-ryan-reynolds-in-the-past>Scarlett Johansson Has Spoken About Her Relationship With Ryan Reynolds In The Past</h2><p>While this was the first time that Johansson has spoken about Reynolds in quite some time, there have been other instances where the Red Notice star's name has been brought up in conversation. And just like with Paltrow, what has been said by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Vicky Christina Barcelona star is nothing but reflective or complementary</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/scarlett-johansson-abc-ml-190722_hpmain_16x9_992.png><p>"[Marriage] grew out of a romance and love and a desire to have a future with somebody and I was very fortunate that I married somebody who turned out to be the person I thought he would be," Johansson stated.</p><p>"Relationships are complicated, and being married is a living, breathing process," Johansson went on to explain. "I think I was not fully aware of the peaks and valleys. I wasn't prepared to hunker down and do the work. Both of us were extremely busy. We spent so much time apart. It's very difficult."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Is Scarlett Johansson Jealous Of Ryan Reynolds And Blake Lively's Relationship?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Either things have always been respectful for Johansson and Reynolds or there was enough of an understanding there to not publicly bash one another. This is something that can be hard to do, especially after a marriage comes to an end. And because of this, there was speculation as to what the state of the relationship was between the two actors in the years after their divorce.</p><h2 id=were-ryan-reynolds-and-scarlett-johansson-always-on-good-terms-after-they-divorced>Were Ryan Reynolds And Scarlett Johansson Always On Good Terms After They Divorced?</h2><p>After the divorce was announced, there were several rumors swirling as to why the marriage ended from Reynolds cheating on Johansson to Johansson being more successful than Reynolds. But it appeared that regardless of what was said, the MCU stars were on good terms. That belief quickly changed, however, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">when reports came out that the two would not be on set with one another</a>. And when this happened, many began to speculate why the dynamics between the former couple had changed.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Deadpool 3': Who Will Wade Wilson Team With On His Next Adventure?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was reported that while Reynolds was working on Deadpool 3, he wanted to make sure that he was not in the same scene as Johansson if she was one of the MCU stars chosen to make a cameo in his movie.</p><p>While the odds of this happening were small, it was interesting that years after they divorced, this is a story that surfaced. As such, it was believed an event was kept under wraps that caused there to be a fairly nasty blowup, one so bad that the two could barely breathe the same air.</p><p>Since this rumor first appeared in 2021, there has been nothing else mentioned about it, making fans wonder if <a href=#>Johansson and Reynolds are friends or enemies</a>. But with Johansson's recent comments about Reynolds, it appears that if there were any bad blood between the two, anything that may have happened is now water under the bridge.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-ryan-reynolds-has-said-about-scarlett-johansson>What Ryan Reynolds Has Said About Scarlett Johansson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ryan-reynolds-2.jpg><p>As tight-lipped as Johansson has been with <a href=#>facts about the relationship</a> past and present with Reynolds, the Spirited actor has been even more so. But the one time that he did mention Johansson, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he did so with the same respect that Scarlett has shown him</a>.</p><p>"Departing a relationship and still maintaining the idea that this is still the same person I married is a great luxury that I experienced," Reynolds explained in the months after the divorce. "Thankfully I was in a relationship where two people chose to remain on the high road in every regard."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Did Ryan Reynolds And Scarlett Johansson Get Divorced?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If there were any issues between Johansson and Reynolds after they divorced, the two kept that to themselves. Instead, they have always had nothing but supportive comments for one another. And unless something drastically changes, that is what can be expected in the future as well.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWiv4yrsJqmXaeyurrOpZusZaOWtqV5wJumrqxdqLCivsueq61lmqS1orrSrKanZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hulk-hogan-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hulk Hogan Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./a-little-suspicious-crossword-clue-nyt-476276.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>A little suspicious Crossword Clue NYT</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-leroux-car-accident-update-death-and-cause-news-gone-viral.html>Ava Leroux Car Accident Update: Death And Cause News Gone Viral</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./baby-smoove-net-worth.html>Baby Smoove Net Worth How Much is Baby Smoove Worth?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./james-remar.html>James Remar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenyon-martin-basketballplayer-htm.html>Kenyon Martin Jr - Biography, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-durant-wiki-height-weight-age-girlfriend-family-biography-more.html>Kevin Durant Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ.
